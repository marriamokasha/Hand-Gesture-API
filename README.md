## Monitoring Metrics

To ensure system health, the following metrics are monitored:

- **Model Metric**: Prediction Latency — to measure how fast the model responds.
- **Data Metric**: Invalid Input Count — to detect malformed input from the frontend.
- **Server Metric**: Total Request Count — to track API usage and load.
